# ActivO

School group project

The assignment was to create an application based on a customers order.
What our customer wanted was an app that could suggest you some activities
for a group (which you've made in the app) of friends.
It was to have some filters, like Free, Inside and Physical, to only show
you suggestions that are relevant.

Made with JavaScript with a MVC setup.
